## 👋 Hi, I'm Yicong Wu 

I’m a research assistant at Zhejiang University, now exploring the intersection of **medicine, artificial intelligence**, and **multi-agent systems**. My journey has taken me from wet-lab biomedical research to frontend development, and now into the evolving world of **large language models (LLMs)** and **clinical decision support**.

### 🚀 Current Focus
I'm particularly interested in:
- 🧠 Multi-agent collaboration with LLMs for **safe and interpretable therapy planning**
- ⚖️ Resolving treatment conflicts in **multimorbidity cases**
- 🔍 Research related to **Medical AI / Clinical NLP / Decision Support**

### 🧪 Background 
- Master of Medicine
- Former front-end developer (JavaScript/React)
- Research assistant at Zhejiang University (Institute for AI)

### 📌 Projects & Publications
- **[LLM-based Multi-Agent Clinical Decision Framework](https://github.com/yourrepo)**  
  Explores safer and conflict-aware therapy recommendation generation through agent collaboration.
- **[Al-assisted multi-model chatbot for disease diagnosis]**  
  Responsible for fullstack development and maintenance, integrated GraphRAG to the system.

> 📝 I’m actively writing and publishing preprints — stay tuned for updates on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/).

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (FastAPI, PyTorch)
- Frontend: React, TailwindCSS, Echarts
